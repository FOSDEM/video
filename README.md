#FOSDEM Video Repository

This repository is meant to keep track of the development for Video on FOSDEM.

The [hardware](https://github.com/FOSDEM/video/tree/master/hardware "hardware") subfolder contains the overview and information that describes the architecture and all things hardware-related of the FOSDEM Video Boxes.

The [Software](https://github.com/FOSDEM/video/tree/master/software "software") subfolder contains the source files to build your own SD card image from scratch for a FOSDEM Video Box.

The [Instructions](https://github.com/FOSDEM/video/tree/master/instructions "instructions") subfolder contains both source files and generated PDF files containing instructions and reference pictures for use during FOSDEM itself.

The [Infrastructure repo](https://github.com/FOSDEM/infrastructure "infrastructure") repo contains the ansible recipes to deploy the video infrastructure.
