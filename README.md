# FOSDEM Video Repository

This repository is meant to keep track of the development for video at FOSDEM.

The [hardware](https://github.com/FOSDEM/video/tree/master/hardware) subfolder contains the overview and information describing the architecture and all things hardware-related of the FOSDEM video setup.

The [software](https://github.com/FOSDEM/video/tree/master/software) subfolder contains the source of scripts and other bits and pieces.

The [instructions](https://github.com/FOSDEM/video/tree/master/instructions) subfolder contains both source files and generated PDF files with instructions and reference pictures for use during FOSDEM itself.

The [infrastructure repository](https://github.com/FOSDEM/infrastructure) contains the ansible recipes to deploy the video infrastructure.
