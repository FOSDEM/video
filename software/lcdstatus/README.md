# Video box status screen

This is a quick Python hack using pygame, rendering a pretty status
overview on the videobox's LCD. This will either be packaged or
moved to the Ansible deployment.

These files have been copied into the ansible roles. Some items still
on the TODO list:

- CPU usage is still too high
- Use a config file instead of having the script as a template
- Fix displaying the IPv6 address
