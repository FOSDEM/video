#Software Architecture

The software hierarchy is dictated by 2 main goals: _recording_ and _streaming_ of the video streams encoded inside the box.

An external server is used to keep backups of the recordings as they are made, and to serve the video streams to the broader audience outside of FOSDEM premises.

Status monitoring is an aspect of the software that has been set up last-minute during FOSDEM 2016, and as development progresses we want to make this an essential integrated element of the software

After the event we have put a lot of effort into the post-processing of the recorded videofiles, and the scripts and files used for this will be documented here as well.
