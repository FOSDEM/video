# FOSDEM 2017 AV devroom manager manual

## Where to get help

* On irc: irc.freenode.net, #fosdem-video
* In person: there is a per-building team in the following locations:
	* AW: under the stairs to the second floor
	* K: at the NOC
	* H: behind the info desk
	* U: in the corridor near Chavanne
* In case of an emergency, call...

## What do you have

* Camera + videobox
* Presenter box (where the speaker will be connected)
* Lapel mic/headset for the speaker
* (optional) handheld microphone for questions from the room
* Interface to control the video mixing, if you want

## Speaker setup

* Connect the speaker's laptop to the video box on the free VGA port. If the speaker doesn't have a VGA port, we have provided a HDMI-to-VGA converter.
	* Make sure that the video box displays the screen of the laptop on its display. The output there is delayed by ~5 seconds.
* Put the microphone on the speaker. Here are some guidelines:
	* The microphone is attached at speaker's clothes near the neck, under the chin (centrally);
	* There are no necklaces, lanyards, scarves, very-long-beards that would touch it during the talk;
	* If there is no place where the microphone can be attached, a lanyard can be used for this purpose, on top of all the clothing of the speaker;
	* The microphone receiver is attached to the belt of the speaker. If not possible, it's attached on top of a pocket;
* Make sure the microphone is on. The audio levels can be checked on the camera.

## Video mixing control

At https://contol.video.fosdem.org/ you can access the video control for your room.

* Username: USERNAME
* Password: PASSWORD

The interface is pretty self-explanatory (and usable even on a mobile phone), you can see the current output, the camera and presenter box sources, and select one from four different views that will go on the stream:

* (DEFAULT) Picture-in-picture - big presentation, small camera view 
* Picture-in-picture - big camera view, small presentation
* Full-screen - camera
* Full-screen - presentation

If you don't want to deal with it, you can leave it at the default, which should be fine for most of the time.

If you want to make most of it, here are a few pointers:

* Use "full-screen - camera" for the introduction and questions part
* Use "Picture-in-picture - big camera view, small presentation" for most of the presentation
* Use "full-screen - presentation" for demonstrations or slides with a lot of small text
