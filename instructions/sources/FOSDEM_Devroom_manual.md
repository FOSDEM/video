# FOSDEM 2017 A/V devroom manager manual, day DAY, room ROOM

## Where to get help

* On IRC: `irc.freenode.net, #fosdem-video`
* In person: there is a per-building team in the following locations:
	* **AW**: under the stairs (in front of AW1.124)
	* **K**: NOC/VOC (end of the corridor in front of K.1.105)
	* **H**: behind the info desk
	* **U**: in the corridor near UD2.120 (Chavanne)
* In case of an emergency, call Mark Van den Borre on `+32-486-961-726` or Vasil Kolev on `+359-888-508044`

## Equipment

* Camera
* Camera video box
* Presenter video box
* Lapel mic/headset for the speaker
* Handheld microphone for audience questions (optional, depends on the room)
* Interface to control the video mixing (optional)

## Starting a presentation

* Connect the speaker's laptop to the video box on the free VGA port. If the speaker doesn't have a VGA port, use an HDMI-to-VGA converter. If you don't have a converter, the video team has a limited supply. Ask for one (and bring it back once you're done).
	* Make sure that the video box displays the screen of the laptop on its display. The output there is delayed by ~5 seconds.
* Make the speaker wear the microphone. Here are some guidelines:
	* The microphone is attached to speaker's clothes, close to the neck, under the chin in the middle of the torso;
	* Ensure no necklaces, lanyards, scarves, beards or other objects that could touch the microphone during the talk;
	* If there is no suitable place to attach the microphone, a lanyard could be used for this purpose;
	* The microphone receiver is attached to the belt of the speaker. If this is not possible, attach it to their pocket;
* **Make sure the microphone is turned on**. The audio levels can be checked on the camera.

## Video mixing control

At `https://control.video.fosdem.org/` you can access the video control for your room.

* Username: `USERNAME`
* Password: `PASSWORD`

The interface is pretty self-explanatory (and usable even on a mobile phone), you can see the current output, the camera and presenter box sources, and select one of four different views that will go on the stream and be recorded:

* Picture-in-picture - big presentation, small camera view (this is the default)
* Picture-in-picture - big camera view, small presentation
* Full-screen - camera
* Full-screen - presentation

If you don't want to deal with this, leave it at the default. This should be fine for most of the presentations.

If you want to make the most of it, these are a few guidelines:

* Use "full-screen - camera" for the introduction and questions
* Use "Picture-in-picture - big camera view, small presentation" for most of the presentation
* Use "full-screen - presentation" for demonstrations or slides with a lot of small text

Be aware that whatever you choose to do will also end up in the final recordings. What is streamed is recorded. We will not re-mix videos after the conference.
