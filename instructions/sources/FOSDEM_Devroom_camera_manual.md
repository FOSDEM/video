## Your job

To ensure proper recording/stream of the talks in the room

## What it consists of

* Making sure the speaker has a microphone;
* That the microphones' sound levels are OK;
	* This means that their levels peak at 90% in the camera audio bars and there is no noise.
* That during the talk the camera sees just the presenter, with the proper settings for the light;
* That the stream has the proper picture on it, via the control of the video mixing (explained below).

## Microphone placement

* The microphone is attached to speaker's clothes, close to the neck, under the chin in the middle of the torso;
* Ensure no necklaces, lanyards, scarves, beards or other objects that could touch the microphone during the talk;
* If there is no suitable place to attach the microphone, a lanyard could be used for this purpose;
* The microphone receiver is attached to the belt of the speaker. If this is not possible, attach it to their pocket;
* **Make sure the microphone is turned on and NOT MUTED** (this is by far the most common issue we have).

## Camera work

There are a few things you need to know/keep in mind:
* The amount of movement of the camera should be minimized. It's better to zoom out a bit than to have to chase the speaker all the time;
* In some rooms the lights are either too bad or turned off so the slides can be seen. If the camera is on automatic mode and sees the screen, it'll try to show that and the speaker will be very dark. This is fixable by:
	* Pointing the camera at the speaker only, without catching the screen, and
	* Tuning the iris of the camera to be able to see the speaker. The iris on the Canon XF100 is configured by XXXXX, on the Sony NX100 by XXXXXXXX.
* The lights in your room are controlled LIGHTINSTRUCTIONSROOM

## Video mixing control

At `https://control.video.fosdem.org/` you can access the video control for your room.

* Username: `USERNAME`
* Password: `PASSWORD`

The interface is pretty self-explanatory (and usable even on a mobile phone), you can see the current output, the camera and presenter box sources, and select one of four different views that will go on the stream and be recorded:

* Picture-in-picture - big presentation, small camera view (this is the default), or swapped
* Full-screen - camera or presentation

If you don't want to deal with this, leave it at the default. This should be fine for most of the presentations.

If you want to make the most of it, these are a few guidelines:

* Use "full-screen - camera" for the intro and Q&A
* Use "Picture-in-picture - big camera view, small presentation" for most of the presentation
* Use "full-screen - presentation" for demonstrations or slides with a lot of small text

Be aware that whatever you choose to do will also end up in the final recordings. What is streamed is recorded. We will not re-mix videos after the conference.

## Misc

During the event the video team will bring fresh batteries at set intervals, for you to install in the microphone(s). If you need help with that, the video team members will assist your. __Please make sure that the microphone is audible in the camera after you replace the batteries.__

To make your job easier, we recommend taping two stripes of duct tape or similar on the floor to mark the end of the camera's field of vision and notifying the speakers to keep in that area. Notifying the speakers before each talk of these boundaries will also help.
