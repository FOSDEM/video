\section{People}
Video is a big task, so there are many people working together to make it all happen. Here's all the teams:

\subsection{AW, H, K, U and J teams}
You should be a team of two per building: AW, H, K and U respectively. J (probably) has a dedicated knowledgeable volunteer.

Coordination with video operations control (VOC) happens through walkies and irc://irc.freenode.net\#fosdem-video.

Your tasks before the conference starts:
\begin{itemize}
  \item take the equipment to the rooms in your building
  \item work from the biggest to the smallest room
  \item do basic setup: cam, sound, plug in cables, basic audio checks with microphones, ... See below for details.
  \item ensure the rooms are ready before the first talk starts
\end{itemize}

During the day, you'll have a fixed spot in the building:
\begin{itemize}
  \item AW: under the stairs
  \item K: at the NOC
  \item H: behind the info desk
  \item U: in the corridor near Chavanne
\end{itemize}

Your job during the conference, with the backup from the VOC team, is to do the following in your building:
\begin{itemize}
  \item monitor video. Hint: bring at least one laptop running mpv.
  \item proactively fix problems with video. In some rooms, this includes preventatively replacing batteries!
\end{itemize}

At the end of the day, they retrieve the cameras for safe storage overnight.


\subsection{Video operations control or VOC}
You are in the NOC in the K building, with ssh access to all video machines: video boxes in the rooms, vocto machines near VOC, streaming backends and frontends, and the web pages showing the videos to our visitors.

Your job is to constantly monitor all the equipment and streams for problems, and to arrange fixes for any that occur. They have visual monitoring of all audio streams.

Do not run out to fix problems yourselves. Delegate to the AW, H, K and U teams. Maintaining contact between everyone is your main priority.

\subsection{In the devroom}
If you are volunteering for video inside a devroom, please:
\begin{itemize}
  \item stay near the video equipment, keeping it safe (from people tripping over cables for example!)
  \item make sure the camera is aimed at the speaker
  \item monitor the devroom video/audio feeds (headphone!) for problems
  \item signal problems to VOC by irc
\end{itemize}

Please do \emph{NOT} disconnect or turn off any equipment yourself. That is the task of the per building team only.

\section{Rooms}
We have 24 rooms: 12 small, 6 large and 6 extra large rooms. Each type of room has a different audio/video setup.
\begin{itemize}
  \item AW: AW1120 (S), AW1121 (S), AW1124 (S), AW1125 (S), AW1126 (S)
  \item K: K1105 (XXL), K3201 (S), K3401 (S), K4201 (S), K4401 (S), K4601 (S)
  \item H: H1201 (L), H1302 (L), H1308 (L), H1309 (L), H2213 (S), H2214 (S), H2215 (XXL)
  \item U: UA2214 (L), UA2220 (XXL), UB2252A (XXL), UD2120 (XXL), UD2218A (L)
  \item J: Janson (XXL)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Small rooms}
These have a projector and a tie pin microphone for the speaker. They use the Canon XF100 camera. Audience questions are picked up by the camera's internal microphone.

\section{FOSDEM video boxes}
The FOSDEM video box will take care of the streaming and recording.
There is no need to operate the controls on the camera (once on and in the correct video mode, which the setup team will have done). The setup team should also have connected the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item at least one network cable
  \item a power cable, connected to mains, with the box already turned on
  \item slides boxes only:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item the right jack connection should be connected to the room audio system
      \item The right VGA connection should be connected to the projector
      \item The left jack connection should have a loose mini-jack cable, for connecting to the presenter laptop
      \item The left VGA connection should have a loose VGA cable, for connecting to the presenter laptop
    \end{itemize}
  \item Cam boxes only:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item An HDMI cable to the (powered on) camera (the SDI connection is for backup and normally not in use)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The power switch is at the back, on a standard power supply:
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 120mm]{videobox_psu.jpg}
\end{figure}

Order of connections and powering on does not matter, each order will work. There is no need to reboot the box after connections have changed, and there is no physical mechanism to safely power down the box.
Fully powering on the box takes about half a minute, and it will take approximately 10 seconds before anything can be seen on the LCD display. This is normal. Boot up is about twice as slow after an unexpected power loss.

\emph{Do not attempt to power off the box unassisted, as this may damage the integrity of the system.}
In the event of power loss or accidental unplugging, the system should fully auto-recover by itself. If you suspect it may be malfunctioning, first try to open the live stream yourself on any device. When problems persist, contact the control and monitoring team (see chapter ``During the event'' for full details). They may already be aware of the problem, but quick reporting helps cut down on reaction times.

While the box contains a network switch (all three ports are connected), \emph{do not connect your own equipment} to the box. The boxes are on a special subnet with reserved bandwidth for the video streaming, and any other equipment may compromise the quality of the broadcast.

\emph{The slides boxes are VGA-only.}
The internals are HDMI-compatible, but the ULB campus projection system only supports VGA.
Sourcing your own HDMI (and/or DP) to VGA converters is advisable, though all speakers will be informed of the VGA requirement beforehand.
The VGA signal is automatically scaled to 720p (1280x720) at 50Hz. Matching this on the presenter laptop is a good idea, but not a requirement.

\emph{The LCD display will inform you of all vital information about the current status of the box.} It shows a preview of the stream image (auto-refreshing screenshot, not live video), the current input resolution and refresh rate (should be 720p at 50Hz), its network status (connected/disconnected), the recording status (yes/no), the streaming status (yes/no) and audio volume level (average over the last few seconds).

The boxes report all this information to control while their network status is good, where the control and monitoring team keeps on eye on all rooms. If something is wrong, they may send somebody your way to correct it. Please follow the instructions (if any) of video team members. Keeping an eye on the box vitals and correcting any problems you notice is encouraged.

\section{Tripod}
More details coming soon.

\section{Camera}
FOSDEM2017 will use 2 different camera models: the Sony HXR-NX100 and the Canon XF100E.

\subsection{Standard settings for both cameras and quick check list}
\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
Resolution & 1280x720 \\
Refresh rate & 50p \\
MIC-CHANNEL1(left) &  Speaker and audience microphone \\
MIC-CHANNEL2(right) & Internal microphone \\
Power source & Cable AND Battery \\
Lens cover & Remove! \\
Camera/Tripod & Cam must be attached to tripod plate \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Setup for Sony HXR-NX100 (large and extra large rooms)}

\subsubsection{Screw camera on mount}
Screw the camera onto the tripod. Every camera has a screw hole at the bottom that can be used for this. The plate has a distinct ``point camera in this direction''-arrow, pay attention to this. The screw can be tightened by a coin or similar object.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 120mm]{Cam00.jpg}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Power and HDMI connectors}
First plug in the battery at the back, then plug in both the HDMI and the power cable.

Both connectors can be found next to each other to the right of the battery slot at the back.
Look at the picture if you're unsure.

Do not forget to hook up the other end of the HDMI cable to the FOSDEM Video Box, and the power cable into the mains.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
\includegraphics[width = 120mm]{Sony01.jpg}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Microphone}
Plug the XLR cable of the audio system into Input2.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
\includegraphics[width = 120mm]{Sony02.jpg}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Power on}
You can find the power button on the left side of the camera (looking from behind). Look in the bottom right corner.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
\includegraphics[width = 120mm]{Sony03.jpg}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Audio settings}
The audio settings can only be done through the hardware switches on the camera.
Make sure to set the switches to the correct positions, as these directly affect the availability of audio on the recordings and live streams. Wrong settings means no audio!
The position of the dials does not matter (those are for manual volume, we use automatic volume).
If unsure, verify with the image below.

\begin{tabular}{| l || l | l | l | l |}
Input & Left switch & Middle switch & Right switch & dial \\ \hline
Input1 & BOTTOM (Mic 48V) & TOP (INT MIC) & TOP (AUTO) & anything \\
Input2 & TOP (Line) & MIDDLE (EXT) & TOP (AUTO) & anything \\
\end{tabular}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
\includegraphics[width = 120mm]{Sony04.jpg}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Video output configuration}
The video configuration will be done through the on-screen display.

Set up like this:

Menu $\rightarrow$ 2nd icon (two arrows) $\rightarrow$ Video out $\rightarrow$ HDMI $\rightarrow$ 720p.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
\includegraphics[width = 120mm]{Sony05.jpg}
\end{figure}

The information displayed on the OSD relates to recording to the SD card, which we do not use. \emph{Ignore this text}, as the video output config is completely separate from the recording setting on this model.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
\includegraphics[width = 120mm]{Sony06.jpg}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Remove the lens cover}
Do not forget to remove the lens cover. Store it in the camera bag for safe keeping.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
\includegraphics[width = 120mm]{Sony07.jpg}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Checklist}
Please check the following before leaving:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Does CH1 on the camera display spike when you tap the (powered on) wireless speaker microphone?
  \item Does CH2 on the camera display spike when you tap the camera itself with your fingers?
  \item Turn off the wireless speaker microphone before leaving to conserve battery power for during the day.
  \item Do both video boxes say mode 720p50 on the LCD display?
  \item Does the camera video box display the camera image on the LCD display?
\end{itemize}

If any of these do not work, re-check your connections and settings. Still no luck? Contract VOC!

\subsubsection{Contact control}
When you have finished setup of the room, please report to VOC for a full test.
They will let you know what rooms still need attention.

\subsection{Setup for Canon XF100E (small rooms)}

\subsubsection{Screw camera on mount}
Screw the camera onto the tripod. Every camera has a screw hole at the bottom that can be used for this. The plate has a distinct ``point camera in this direction''-arrow, pay attention to this. The screw can be tightened by a coin or similar object.

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
\includegraphics[width = 120mm]{Canon03.jpg}
\end{figure}

After booting the camera, please check if:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the avx microphone receiver should power on (signaling through 48V phantom power)
  \item the transmitter auto pairs with the receiver. It should show "AVX" plus the latest four digits of the receiver serial on its lcd
  \item the transmitter battery status. Fully charged, it should indicate approximately 15 hours on the lcd
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
\includegraphics[width = 120mm]{paired_avx.jpg}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Audio settings}

  \item Do both video boxes say mode 720p50 on the LCD display?
  \item Does the camera video box display the camera image on the LCD display?
\end{itemize}

If any of these do not work, re-check your connections and settings. Still no luck? Contract control!

\subsubsection{Warn VOC}
When you've finished setting up the room, please report this to VOC by walkie and on irc://irc.freenode.net\#fosdem-video.

\section{During the event}
It is expected of the devroom video volunteers that they keep an eye on the following, in order of importance:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The wireless speaker mic is on during talks
  \item The wireless speaker mic is worn correctly
  \item The audio volume is not too low or too high (clipping is bad!)
  \item The camera is aimed at the speaker, \emph{not} the projection screen (the projection screen is captured separately!)
  \item None of the video equipment is stolen or tampered with
  \item The video box is turned on and has OK network status.
\end{itemize}
The main task is ensuring audio quality. Video quality, while important, is only a secondary concern. A recording without video is still usable, but a recording without audio is completely useless.

Video team members will be both monitoring remotely as well as visiting rooms with problems. If you have questions, concerns or problems and there is no video team member nearby, contact them through the \texttt{\#fosdem-video} channel on the Freenode IRC service. If your video box shows issues on the LCD, most likely somebody is already on their way to you. When communicating with video team members, please mention the \emph{room number} as opposed to the devroom name. Devrooms move around, room numbers stay constant.
