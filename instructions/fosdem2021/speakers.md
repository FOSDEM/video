- Make sure your room ends up marked with state "done" at https://upload.video.fosdem.org/overview .

### Talk Q&A: audience interaction using Matrix/Jitsi
While your talk will be broadcast as prerecorded video, you will have a chance to interact with your talk audience in a live q&a session. FOSDEM 2021 will use https://chat.fosdem.org for that.

Here's what you'll need to do for the q&a session to go smoothly:
- Accept your https://chat.fosdem.org invite. Create your matrix account on https://chat.fosdem.org .
  - Potential spam issue with gmail.

- Get familiar with the matrix rooms for your talk:
  - #talk-123456:fosdem.org
    - This room is invite only. It's accessible only to you, your q&a session host and FOSDEM staff.
  - The general audience room for your talk.
    - You should have received an invitation to this room.
    - Alternatively, [schedule](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/events/) will tell you the name of your room:
