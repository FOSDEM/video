### Talk Q&A: audience interaction using Matrix/Jitsi
After your talk has been broadcast as prerecorded video, you will have a chance to address your audio's questions in a live broadcast q&a session. FOSDEM 2021 will use https://chat.fosdem.org for that. This is a **matrix server with FOSDEM specific enrichments** only available using the **https://chat.fosdem.org web client. Please do not use any other matrix client.**

Here's what you'll need to do for the q&a session to go smoothly:
- Accept your https://chat.fosdem.org invite. Create your matrix account on https://chat.fosdem.org .
  - Potential spam issue with gmail.

- Get familiar with the matrix rooms for your talk:
  - [#talk-123456:fosdem.org](https://chat.fosdem.org/#/room/#talk-123456:fosdem.org)
    - This room is invite only. It's accessible only to you as a speaker, your optional co-speakers, your q&a session host and FOSDEM staff.
  - The general audience room for your talk.
    - You should have received an invitation to this room.
    - Alternatively, you can derive your matrix room from the [schedule](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/events/). Examples: D.cloud => [#cloud:fosdem.org](https://chat.fosdem.org/#/room/#cloud:fosdem.org), M.misc => [#misc:fosdem.org](https://chat.fosdem.org/#/room/#misc:fosdem.org) .
