this branch contains instrumentation to debug the USB audio crashes.

in order to reproduce the crash, use something like this:

alsaloop -C hw:0 -P hw:0 -t 10000

(just pipe some audio from capture to output)


the file ../udev_rules/20-fosdem-serial.rules can be placed in /etc/udev/rules.d
in order to enumerate the serial endpoints correctly.

afterwards, a serial terminal can be connected to /dev/tty_fosdem_audio_debug:
    picocom --imap lfcrlf --echo /dev/tty_fosdem_audio_debug

the audio board will only boot after this terminal has been connected. If a crash happens,
information will be printed into this terminal.

You can use the following comand to find the line number of the crash:
    arm-none-eabi-addr2line -e build/teensy_audio.elf 0xFOO
where 0xFOO is the address from the crash report.
