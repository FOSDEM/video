## Disassembly of old box
The box should be fully disassembled using a 2mm HEX screwdriver.
The following parts should be salvaged for the new box:

- The lid and bottom
- The 3D-printed inserts that hold the box together
- The HDMI Neutrik connectors, together with their nuts and bolts
- The Hagibis capture card

Everything else can be discarded (not used for the new box).

If the Hagibis capture card is inside its case, it should be disassembled:
- Remove bumpers on bottom together with any glue residue
- Remove the screws from under the bumper
- Pull on the bottom lid. If needed, insert a thin tool through one of the HDMI port holes and gently push the port downwards.
- Insert the thin tool into the gap between the lid and the case and open the box
- Salvage the board and discard the rest

Discarded parts should be kept in separate containers for further usage.

## Assembly of new box

![assembly flowchart](assembly.svg)

Legend (colours to be removed after assembly on 2024-12-28):
- Green means already done before assembly
- Red means skip (will be done later or not at all)
- Yellow means optional (do only for some of the boxes)

### Outline of steps

#### Attach neutrik connector to back plate (`attach_neutrik_connector_to_back_plate`)
- Use the M3x10 bolts and respective nuts to attach the connector

#### Clean baseplate thermal area (`clean_baseplate_thermal_area`)
- Use a cotton swab and isopropyl alcohol to clean the area where the CPU will contact the baseplate.
This is between the two rectangular cutouts under the Radxa X4.

#### Crimp fan connectors (`crimp_fan_connectors`)
- Cut the fan wires to about 70mm
- Hold the [connector](https://www.te.com/en/product-3-640443-3.html) in a vise with the wire slots pointing up. The vise should have a rubber grip. Do not tighten more than needed (the connector should not deform)
- The wire order is as follows (left to right, wires going into the connector from the point of view of the human outwards):
    1. Tach (Yellow)
    2. +5V (Red)
    3. GND (Black)
- If in doubt about the pin order, take a power board and consult the labels on the board
- Use the [MTA100 crimping tool](https://www.modellbahnunion.com/HO-gauge/Crimping-tool.htm?shop=modellbahn-union-en&a=article&ProdNr=Zimo-CRIMPTOOL&p=802) to crimp the individual wires
- It would be beneficial to hold multiple connectors in one vise grip and pipeline the crimping process

#### Cut power cable (`cut_pwr_cable`)
- Prepare 2x1.5mmÂ² red-black low voltage copper cable
- Cut 260mm of cable

#### Strip ends of power cable (`strip_ends_of_pwr_cable`)
- Use a [wire stripping tool](https://www.knipex.com/products/wire-strippers-and-stripping-tools/knipex-precistrip16/knipex-precistrip16/1252195) to strip about 5mm on each side

#### Tin ends of power cable (`tin_ends_of_pwr_cable`)
- Hold the cable in a vise with the stripped ends pointing upwards or to the side
- Apply flux on wire
- Heat wire with soldering iron while gradually applying enough solder to fill the space between internal strands

#### Remove ring from barrel jack (`remove_ring_from_barrel_jack`)
I always forget to do this and then curse when I get to inserting the barrel jack into the panel.
This should be done before soldering because otherwise the thread might lock because of the heat.

#### Solder power cable to barrel jack (`solder_pwr_cable_to_barrel_jack`)
- Hold the [barrel jack](https://www.schurter.com/en/datasheet/4840.2200) in a vise
- Solder the wires to the pins in the following configuration:
    - The bigger plank is the (+) wire (red cable)
    - The pin opposite that plank is the (-)
    - The third pin is unused


#### Insert power cable through back panel (`insert_pwr_cable_through_back_panel`)
Do not forget to do this before attaching the terminal!

#### Insert ring on barrel jack (`insert_ring_on_barrel_jack`)
Do not forget to do this before attaching the terminal!

#### Attach terminal to power cable (`attach_terminal_to_pwr_cable`)
- Attach a [Plug-in terminal](https://store.comet.bg/Catalogue/Product/45028/) to the wires.
Looking at the terminal from the front (holes), the pin order is the following:
    - Left pin is +12V (red)
    - Right pin is GND (black)
- If in doubt about the pin order, take a power board and consult the labels on the board

#### Strip ends of radxa power cable (`strip_ends_of_radxa_pwr_cable`)
- The cables come with the ends stripped to about 2mm - they should instead be stripped to 5mm

#### Attach terminal to radxa power cable (`attach_terminal_to_radxa_pwr_cable`)
- **FIXME**: undocumented

#### Mount fuse on power brd (`mount_fuse_on_pwr_brd`)
- **FIXME**: undocumented

#### Mount teensy on audio brd (`mount_teensy_on_audio_brd`)
- **FIXME**: undocumented

#### Place display on display hat (`place_display_on_display_hat`)
- **FIXME**: undocumented

#### Prepare thermal pad (`prepare_thermal_pad`)
- **FIXME**: undocumented

#### Remove artifacts from display holders (`remove_artifacts_from_display_holders`)
- **FIXME**: undocumented

#### Connect micro hdmi cable (`connect_micro_hdmi_cable`)
- **FIXME**: undocumented

#### Dilate radxa holes (`dilate_radxa_holes`)
- Use a 3mm drill to drill through the holes on the Radxa X4
- Use a paintbrush/vacuum cleaner to remove dust

#### Clean radxa cpu (`clean_radxa_cpu`)
- Use a cotton swab and isopropyl alcohol to clean the CPU crystal

#### Stick thermal pad on radxa (`stick_thermal_pad_on_radxa`)
- Cut an approx 18x20mm rectangle of 1.5mm thick thermal pad
- Remove protecting films from both sides
- Stick thermal pad onto CPU crystal

#### Mount radxa on baseplate (`mount_radxa_on_baseplate`)
- Without tightening, screw the Radxa board with M3x5 bolts and serrated washers to the baseplate
- Tighten diagonally

#### Mount display holders on baseplate (`mount_display_holders_on_baseplate`)
- Screw the display holders onto the baseplate with M3x5 bolts

#### Mount hagibis rear on baseplate (`mount_hagibis_rear_on_baseplate`)
- Use M4x5 bolts in the two rear holes of the Hagibis capture card. They might require some effort to screw in - this is fine.
- This must be done before bolting the front holes, since the rear holes use thicker bolts that guide the board orientation.

#### Mount hagibis front on baseplate (`mount_hagibis_front_on_baseplate`)
- Use M3x5 bolts and serrated washers

#### Mount switch, power and audio boards on baseplate (`mount_sap_on_baseplate`)
- Use M3x5 bolts and serrated washers to mount boards to the baseplate
- Tighten diagonally

#### Place display hat on display holders (`place_display_hat_on_display_holders`)
- The display hat PCB slides into the rear slit, while the display slides into the front slit
- The MTA100 connectors should be on top

#### Place radxa hat on radxa without connecting (`place_radxa_hat_on_radxa_without_connecting`)
- We will later have to click the bootsel button that is under the radxa hat, so
there's no need to plug the hat in now - just place it on top of the Radxa, so that the
cabling layout can be realistic.

#### Base assembled (`base_assembled`)
Preparation is now done, and we can begin cable management.

#### Connect power cable to power board (`connect_pwr_cable_to_pwr_board`)
- Insert the terminal into the right terminal (labeled "PWR IN").
- Do not swap the two terminals!

- Insert the terminal into the left terminal (labeled "PWR OUT").
- Do not swap the two terminals!
