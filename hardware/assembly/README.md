![assembly flowchart](assembly.svg)

Legend (colours to be removed after assembly on 2024-12-28):
- Green means already done before assembly
- Red means skip (will be done later or not at all)
- Yellow means optional (do only for some of the boxes)

### Before we begin


#### Disassemble old box (`prepare_box`)

When salvaging a pre-2024 FOSDEM box, it should be fully disassembled.

The box should be fully disassembled using a 2mm HEX screwdriver.
The following parts should be salvaged for the new box:

- The lid and bottom
- The 3D-printed inserts that hold the box together
- The HDMI Neutrik connectors, together with their nuts and bolts
- The Hagibis capture card

Everything else can be discarded (not used for the new box).

#### Prepare a new box (`prepare_box`)

In case of using a brand new box ([G17081UBK](https://www.gainta.com/en/g17081ubk.html)), it should be prepared in the following way:

- Discard the unused parts
    - Only the top/bottom halves are used, everything else (front/back covers, planks) is discarded
- Drill the 4mm high screw holes with a 2.8mm drill bit
    - 2.8mm drill bits are very uncommon, make sure you have them available
    - It is best to use a tabletop drill press
    - Do not drill through the whole box, just drill about 3.5mm deep
- Drill through the supports on the bottom half
    - The lid and bottom of the box are identical and each have 4 support columns
    - The bottom supports should be drilled through with a 3mm drill, so that the box can be screwed together
- 3D-printed inserts ([case locks](https://github.com/FOSDEM/video/blob/master/hardware/brackets/case-lock.scad)) for the four corners should be made available

#### Disassemble enclosed Hagibis capture card (`disassemble_hagibis_if_needed`)

If the Hagibis capture card is inside its case, it should be disassembled:
- Remove bumpers on bottom together with any glue residue
- Remove the screws from under the bumper
- Pull on the bottom lid. If needed, insert a thin tool through one of the HDMI port holes and gently push on the sides of the HDMI port to move it downwards. IMPORTANT - you need to push on the sides and not in the middle of the HDMI port, because it will bend.
- Insert the thin tool into the gap between the lid and the case and open the box
- Salvage the board and discard the rest

Discarded parts should be kept in separate containers for further usage.

### Box assembly


#### Attach neutrik connector to back plate (`attach_neutrik_connector_to_back_plate`)

- Use the M3x10 bolts and respective nuts to attach the connector
- One lower bolt may need to be removed if it does not fit with the inner aluminum heatplate

#### Crimp fan connectors (`crimp_fan_connectors`)

- Cut the fan wires to about 70mm
- Hold the [connector](https://www.te.com/en/product-3-640443-3.html) in a vise with the wire slots pointing up. The vise should have a rubber grip. Do not tighten more than needed (the connector should not deform)
- The wire order is as follows (left to right, wires going into the connector from the point of view of the human outwards):
    1. Tach (Yellow)
    2. +5V (Red)
    3. GND (Black)
- If in doubt about the pin order, take a power board and consult the labels on the board
- Use the [MTA100 crimping tool](https://www.modellbahnunion.com/HO-gauge/Crimping-tool.htm?shop=modellbahn-union-en&a=article&ProdNr=Zimo-CRIMPTOOL&p=802) to crimp the individual wires
- It would be beneficial to hold multiple connectors in one vise grip and pipeline the crimping process

#### Cut power cable (`cut_pwr_cable`)

- Prepare 2x1.5mmÂ² red-black low voltage copper cable
- Cut 260mm of cable

#### Strip ends of power cable (`strip_ends_of_pwr_cable`)

- Use a [wire stripping tool](https://www.knipex.com/products/wire-strippers-and-stripping-tools/knipex-precistrip16/knipex-precistrip16/1252195) to strip about 5mm on each side

#### Tin ends of power cable (`tin_ends_of_pwr_cable`)

- Hold the cable in a vise with the stripped ends pointing upwards or to the side
- Apply flux on wire
- Heat wire with soldering iron while gradually applying enough solder to fill the space between internal strands

#### Remove ring from barrel jack (`remove_ring_from_barrel_jack`)

I always forget to do this and then curse when I get to inserting the barrel jack into the panel.
This should be done before soldering because otherwise the thread might lock because of the heat.

<img src="pics/remove_ring_from_barrel_jack.jpg" height="300px" />

#### Solder power cable to barrel jack (`solder_pwr_cable_to_barrel_jack`)

- Hold the [barrel jack](https://www.schurter.com/en/datasheet/4840.2200) in a vise
- Solder the wires to the pins in the following configuration:
    - The bigger plank is the (+) wire (red cable)
    - The pin opposite that plank is the (-) wire
    - The third pin is unused

<img src="pics/solder_pwr_cable_to_barrel_jack.jpg" height="250px" />


#### Insert power cable through back panel (`insert_pwr_cable_through_back_panel`)

#### Insert ring on barrel jack (`insert_ring_on_barrel_jack`)

Do not forget to do this before attaching the terminal!

#### Attach terminal to power cables (`attach_terminal_to_pwr_cable`, `attach_terminal_to_radxa_pwr_cable`))

- Use 1.5mm flathead screwdriver
- Attach a [Plug-in terminal](https://store.comet.bg/Catalogue/Product/45028/) to the wires.
Looking at the terminal from the front (holes), the pin order is the following:
    - Left pin is +12V (red)
    - Right pin is GND (black)
- If in doubt about the pin order, take a power board and consult the labels on the board
- Repeat the steps for both the power cable and the radxa power cable

<img src="pics/attach_terminal_to_radxa_pwr_cable.png" height="200px" />

#### Strip ends of radxa power cable (`strip_ends_of_radxa_pwr_cable`)

- The cables come with the ends stripped to about 2mm - they should instead be stripped to 5mm

#### Mount fuse on power brd (`mount_fuse_on_pwr_brd`)

- Snap the fuse onto the fuse holder
<img src="pics/mount_fuse_on_pwr_brd.png" height="250px" />

#### Mount teensy on audio brd (`mount_teensy_on_audio_brd`)

- The teensy's direction is indicated by the "USB" label on the silkscreen
- Lay the audio board on a flat, soft surface
- Gently push the teensy downwards with two fingers placed symmetrically

<img src="pics/mount_teensy_on_audio_brd.png" height="250px" />

#### Place display on display hat (`place_display_on_display_hat`)

#### Remove artifacts from display holders (`remove_artifacts_from_display_holders`)

- Use a 4mm drill bit or a knife to remove artifacts from the bottom of the holes

#### Connect micro hdmi cable (`connect_micro_hdmi_cable`)

- The cable should be connected between the port labeled **HDMI1** on the Radxa and the neutrik connector on the back panel

#### Dilate radxa holes (`dilate_radxa_holes`)

- Use a 3mm drill to drill through the holes on the Radxa X4
- Use a paintbrush/vacuum cleaner to remove dust

#### Apply threadlock to baseplate (`apply_threadlock_to_baseplate`)

- Drop a single drop of [Loctite 242](https://www.henkel-adhesives.com/us/en/product/threadlockers/loctite_2430.1329467.html)
into the threaded standoffs that will be used

#### Clean baseplate thermal area (`clean_baseplate_thermal_area`)

- Use a cotton swab and isopropyl alcohol to clean the area where the CPU will contact the baseplate.
This is between the two rectangular cutouts under the Radxa X4.

#### Attach front panel to audio brd (`attach_front_panel_to_audio_brd`)

- Be careful with the XLR connector pins
- Make sure the XLR connectors fit nicely into the holes

#### Slide base and panels into box (`slide_base_and_panels_into_box`)

- Make sure that the bottom half of the box is actually a bottom and not a lid
(the holes are drilled through, and if the box is an old one, one of the grill bars is broken)
- If the box is an old one, make sure the slit for fans on the baseplate is not oriented
towards the broken grill
- Slide the front panel and base assembly in

#### Attach onlyfans to box (`attach_onlyfans_to_box`)

- Use 3x 2.5mm-wide cable ties to tie through the bottom holes of the fans
    - One of them ties the two middle holes (next to each other) to one of the box bars
    - The other two tie the faraway holes on the two sides
