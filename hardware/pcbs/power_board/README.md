## power board

This is a PCB with the following features:
- Passthrough, filtering and fusing of 12V power from the PSU
- GPIO passthrough and level shifting for:
    - PWM fans
    - Buttons with LEDs (or just buttons, or just LEDs) - like [this one](https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Shin-Chin/R13-508BL-05-BRR12V?qs=gZXFycFWdAOqSBZAzEyqbA%3D%3D)
- A temperature sensor
- USB3 passthrough
- External USBs with isolated grounds for charging, designed to be able to power Sennheiser AVX receivers

Internal connections:
- 1x 12V input (2-pin screw terminal), connects to PSU's 12V output
- 3x 12V outputs (2-pin screw terminals), one of which powers an SBC like the [Radxa X2L](https://radxa.com/products/x/x2l/), the others are spare
- 2x 5V outputs (2-pin screw terminals), for misc purposes
- 1x USB3-micro-B port for USB3 passthrough
- 1x 3-pin IÂ²C header that connects to the SBC's GPIO
- 4x 4-pin fan connectors with pwm
- 4x 4-pin connectors for buttons-with-LEDs or leds (VDD-LED-BTN-VDD)

Panel components:
- 1x optional 12V input barrel connector, in case we use an external PSU
- 1x USB3-A passthrough port
- 4x USB2-A charging connectors

Proposed changes:
- make the fan connectors 4 instead of 5
- make the fan controller support 3-pin 5v fans instead of 4-pin 12v fans
- make the fan connectors be 3-pin screw terminals (now that I think of it, this is probably a bad idea... screw terminals are huge - maybe it's better to use molex connectors after all, but this would mean having to attach a male connector to every single fan, e.g. 600 of them - I'm not sure what the good tradeoff here is)
- remove the 3 software-controlled leds (but keep the extra gpio pin header)
- remove the 12V input connector, leave only the barrel jack
- remove all internal "spare power" connectors and replace them with a single header that has all voltages
- make the board in such a shape that it doesn't cover the hole that will be used for mounting the bracket
- outset the barrel connector a bit to the outside, since it's supposed to go through the front panel (as opposed to the USBs, which are supposed to be behind)
